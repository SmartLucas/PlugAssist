PlugAssist
==========

Welcome to this Repo. PlugAssist is a script that was at first a dev learning project, but now, it is public, so feel free to use it.

What can it do?
==========

* Custom Background
* Afk Respond
* Join / Leave Messages
* Chat colors
* Different Languages
* **New** Changeable backgrounds
* **_Working_** Private messaging 

But How?
==========

Here is a Code. It should be copied and pasted as a bookmark link. 

```javascript
javascript:(function(){if (API.enabled && $("#PlugAssist-css").length <= 0) {$.getScript('https://www.dropbox.com/s/rw749rn6jv3vgwy/PlugAssist-2-0.js?dl=1');}else {API.sendChat('/close'); $.getScript('https://www.dropbox.com/s/rw749rn6jv3vgwy/PlugAssist-2-0.js?dl=1');}}());
```

Can I help?
===========
